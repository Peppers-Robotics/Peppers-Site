			<p>Peppers STEM Special is an event through which we aim to introduce middle school students to the STEM field and show them its importance in everyday life. The activity consists of presenting each letter of STEM through practical examples and interactive discussions designed to spark their interest.
			</p>
			<p>Initially, the project was called Peppers Christmas Special and took place only during the winter. Over time, we realized that a single annual activity offering children the opportunity to discover the STEM field was not enough, so it evolved into Peppers STEM Special, making it accessible throughout the entire year.

			<p>“Dăruiește un robot” is a community engagement project through which our team aims to increase access to STEM education, especially among students from schools with limited resources. The main objective of the project is to familiarize children with basic concepts in robotics, electronics, and programming through hands-on and interactive activities tailored to their level of understanding.
			</p>
			<p>In the current season, the “Dăruiește un robot” project was carried out in two schools, involving four classes and a total of approximately 100 students.
Unlike the previous season, when each school was visited only once, this year we returned multiple times to the same classes, which allowed for the consolidation of knowledge and a deeper understanding of the concepts presented.

			<p>RoboReach is an event dedicated to promoting the STEM community among students with disabilities. It involves visiting specialized centers that run well-organized programs. During these visits, our team has the opportunity to present both our own activities and the mechanisms and functionalities of our robot, as well as to explain its programming and mechanics using Arduino kits.
			</p>
			<p>Through this event, we aim to contribute to creating an inclusive environment in which all children, regardless of the challenges they face, have the opportunity to discover the beauty of technology and innovation. RoboReach is not just a presentation of our work, but also a way to inspire and encourage children with disabilities to explore the field of robotics and STEM.

			<p>Between October 27–31, our team organized PeppWeen, a course-and-competition event focused on creating games in Scratch, dedicated to children passionate about programming and creativity.</p>
<p>The event began on October 27 with an introductory Scratch course, after which we launched the actual competition. On October 28, we held a Q&A session during which we answered all the questions received from participants on the first day.
			</p>
			<p>The children had a few days to create their own game, with the theme of Halloween and archaeology. By the end of the event, we received 9 game submissions, and we awarded prizes to several games across different categories.
			 </p>
			 <p>To improve our organization and the participants’ experience at future events, we also created a feedback form, the responses to which will help us plan even more successful editions in the future.</p>

			<p>PeppStrike is a Counter-Strike 2 competition organized among FTC teams in Romania. We chose to organize this event because we wanted to bring an extra element of fun and relaxation during demanding work periods, both on the technical and non-technical sides.
			</p>
			<p>By organizing this competition, we learned how to manage an online event, from communicating with the participating teams to establishing a common schedule, considering the difficulty of finding time slots that worked for all registered teams. The event helped strengthen relationships between FTC teams and created a more unified and friendly environment within the community.

			<p>LIIS STEM Junior is an event organized by our high school, together with our team and CyLiis, where we aim to introduce Arduino knowledge to the middle school students of the school. The courses are structured in two parts: Teaching Courses, where we present the interface and how the Arduino kit works, and Practical Application, where students use the knowledge they have gained to try to create their own circuits. In these courses, we managed to work with students from six 5th and 6th grade classes.

			<p>At the beginning of the weekend of November 14–16, we organized, together with Simigeria Petru, a series of two courses dedicated to artificial intelligence.
			</p>
			<p>The participants learned how these technologies work and how to properly use the tools available to them. In addition to the first session, we also held a second course, which introduced basic concepts for creating a custom model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from 26 × 26 pixel images.
			 </p>
			 <p>The purpose of the event was to clarify the misconceptions many people have about artificial intelligence, while also giving interested participants the opportunity to showcase their passion in front of an audience.

			<p>House of Rookies is the event through which we offer interested students the opportunity to join our team and discover the world of robotics. The process begins with completing an online form, which allows us to become familiar with the knowledge the participants already have.
			</p>
			<p>Next comes a series of introductory courses, organized according to the six departments of our team. These courses include both a theoretical foundation, delivered through sessions led by mentors, and a practical component, where participants apply their knowledge to concrete projects.
			 </p>
			 <p>Finally, participants undergo an interview, during which we look for students who are enthusiastic, motivated to learn, and eager to contribute to the team’s development. We focus on identifying those who demonstrate gracious professionalism, teamwork, or a willingness to develop these qualities, as well as a minimum level of knowledge in their area of interest.

			<p>We shared thoughts and advice with 14 teams, including Ro2D2 (Romania), Cyber Eagles (Canada), The Inventors (Greece), Xeo (Romania), RoboPlayers (USA), CyberLIS76 (Romania), and SEN (Kazakhstan). These discussions provided a diverse perspective on how each team approaches competitions and what lessons can be learned from their experiences.
			</p>
			<p>Our podcast explores the engineering process of teams through the questions we ask them. Invited teams share the stages of designing, testing, and improving their robots, providing valuable resources for those who want to optimize their own designs and performance by following our episodes.
			 </p>
			 <p>Through PeppTalks, we expand our network and collaborate with individuals involved in STEM, including members of FTC teams, who provide useful insights about previous seasons. We have conducted numerous interviews with students who actively contribute to STEM, strengthening connections and promoting knowledge exchange within the FTC community.

			<p>AI vs Human Art is an event held during the months of November, December, and February, through which we aim to encourage young people passionate about the arts and explore together how artificial intelligence generates images. The event involves awarding prizes for drawings alongside a comparison with AI-generated work on the same theme. In this way, we learn more about the impact of AI in our lives and how human perception differs from it.
			</p>
			<p>To make it as accessible as possible, AI vs Human Art uses an online registration system, with all drawings submitted in digital format. The winners are announced on Peppers team’s social media channels and will be showcased in an exhibition at our high school in Iași.
			 </p>
			 <p>We hope that through this event we can spark young people’s interest in AI awareness and in appreciating traditional forms of artistic expression.</p>

			<p>PeppQuest is an event dedicated to middle and high school students, in which participants take part in interactive training sessions on CAD, mechanics, programming, and robotics. The purpose of these activities is to develop their technical thinking, creativity, and ability to work practically on a real project.
			</p>
			<p>After the training phase, students receive an Arduino project, which intentionally comes with some missing parts. They must design the necessary components and 3D print them, then assemble the entire system, combining the hardware and software aspects. Additionally, participants are given a pre-written but incomplete source code, and their task is to understand its logic and find the missing sections so that the robot functions correctly.
